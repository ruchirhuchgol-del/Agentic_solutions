# Welcome to the HGA Documentation

The **Hypothesis Generation Agent (HGA)** is an advanced AI-powered tool designed to revolutionize the way data science projects begin. By automating the critical process of hypothesis formulation, HGA empowers data scientists to move from business questions to rigorous statistical analysis in a fraction of the time.

This documentation is your comprehensive guide to using, understanding, and contributing to the HGA project.

## 📖 How to Use This Documentation

-   **[User Guide](user_guide/getting_started.md)**: If you're a data scientist or analyst looking to use HGA to accelerate your work, start here. This section covers installation, configuration, and how to write effective business problems.
-   **[Developer Guide](developer_guide/architecture.md)**: If you're a developer who wants to understand the codebase, contribute to the project, or extend its functionality, this section is for you. It details the architecture, development workflow, and coding standards.
-   **[API Reference](api/agents.md)**: This section provides an auto-generated, technical reference for all the classes, functions, and modules in the project.

## 🌟 Key Concepts

At its core, HGA is built on a **multi-agent architecture**. Instead of one monolithic AI, a team of specialized agents collaborates:

-   The **Context Extractor** understands your business problem.
-   The **Hypothesis Generator** formulates the statistical hypotheses.
-   The **Test Recommender** suggests the right statistical test.
-   The **Statistical Validator** acts as a peer reviewer to ensure quality.
-   The **Reviewer** synthesizes everything into a final, polished report.

This collaborative approach, powered by [CrewAI](https://crewai.com/), ensures a level of depth, accuracy, and reliability that a single AI model cannot achieve.
