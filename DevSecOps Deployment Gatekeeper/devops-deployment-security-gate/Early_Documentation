DevSecOps Deployment Gatekeeper: Project Documentation
1. Project Overview
Vision Statement
To create an automated security checkpoint in the CI/CD pipeline that prevents deployments with critical security vulnerabilities, enhancing the security posture of production environments while maintaining development velocity.

Mission Statement
Develop an intelligent automation system that integrates with existing development tools to scan, analyze, and block potentially harmful code changes before they reach production environments.

Goals
Implement a zero-tolerance policy for critical vulnerabilities in production deployments
Reduce the time between vulnerability detection and remediation
Enhance security awareness among development teams through immediate feedback
Create an auditable trail of security checks and decisions
Minimize false positives that could hinder development productivity
Success Criteria
100% of pull requests undergo security scanning before merging
Zero critical vulnerabilities deployed to production
Security feedback provided to developers within 10 minutes of PR submission
95% reduction in manual security review time
Integration with existing toolset without significant workflow disruption
2. System Architecture
High-Level Architecture
The DevSecOps Deployment Gatekeeper follows an event-driven architecture with four main components:

Trigger Module: Monitors GitHub for new pull requests
Analysis Engine: Coordinates SonarQube security scans
Decision Engine: Evaluates scan results against security policies
Notification System: Communicates results through GitHub and Slack
Component Interactions
